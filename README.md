# spearmint3
JasperSnoek's spearmint tool (https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) ported into python3. Just a few syntactical changes seemed to be required, but may be full of errors.

Simply clone into your python path folder and rename from 'spearmint3' to 'spearmint.' For implementation notes see the original github linked above.
