# spearmint3
JasperSnoek's spearmint tool (https://github.com/JasperSnoek/spearmint) ported into python3. Just a few syntactical changes seemed to be required.

Simply clone into your python path folder and rename from 'spearmint3' to 'spearmint.' For implementation notes see the original github linked above.
